# autohotkey_libraries
 
This is a collection of libraries I often use. Some of them are rewritten to be used as classes.

I tried to document everything as well as I could. If I didn't write a function by myself, look for **@Source** to find the source.  
Most things are changed or rewritten to fit my needs or preferences.

## Array

extends functionality for arrays on the base object  
This allows to do use some methods on the array itself, rather than calling a function and passing the array

## base64
